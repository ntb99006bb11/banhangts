## Envato Tuts+ Tutorial: [How to Create an AJAX Powered Live Product Search Widget for WooCommerce](https://tutsplus.io/tutorials/34209/edit)
### Instructor: [Karen Pogosyan](https://tutsplus.com/authors/karen-pogosyan)

AJAX (Asynchronous Javascript and XML) is a way of getting a web page to communicate with a server, updating its content without reloading the page. In WooCommerce AJAX enables us to add products directly to the shopping cart, customize products on the fly, filter product lists, and much more.

In this tutorial we’re going to build a product “live search” plugin, with a product category filter and keyword input. All, of course, powered by AJAX.

Our plugin will give us a custom widget which can then be placed anywhere in the WooCommerce store.
